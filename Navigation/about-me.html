					<h2> My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </h2>
					<img src="mike-baker-3Y366aqddJ0-unsplash-1200x1652.jpg" alt="john doe" class="image-full">
					<p> <strong>I used to be a pack rat </strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. </p>
					<p> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
					<h3> How I turned things around </h3>
					<p><strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything </strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. </p>
					<h3> Now I live the simple life </h3>
					<p> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. </p>
					<p> With how much it turned my life around, <strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it </strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site! </p>
